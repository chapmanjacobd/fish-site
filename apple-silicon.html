<h2>fish shell on Apple Silicon</h2>

The Macs announced in Nov 2020 use a new processor architecture, and run legacy software through an x86 emulation layer. fish works emulated, but works better when native.

<h4>To install native built fish:</h4>

<ol><li>The <a href="https://fishshell.com/#platform_tabs">official Mac installer and app</a> are universal for fish 3.1.2 and later, as of Nov 24, 2020. If you have previously installed fish through the package, re-download from the main site and re-install.</li>

<li>MacPorts users will get native fish.</li>

<li>Homebrew users using an <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">ARM native install</a> may install as normal <code>brew install fish</code>. Expect the install to take some time, as it currently builds from source.</li>

<li>Homebrew users using an emulated install will get emulated fish. This works fine, except that all processes it creates will also be emulated.</li>
</ol>

<h4>To check the status of your install:</h4>

From within fish, run:
<p><pre>lipo -info (status fish-path)</pre>
If it says "x86_64 arm64" (or just "arm64") then fish is built native. If it says "x86_64" only, fish is running in emulated mode.
